# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth graders with 'NaNs' while keeping the rest of the data intact. The reasoning for the replacement of the math and reading scores for Thomas High School ninth graders is evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically, the altering of previous grades. Once the THS ninth graders math and reading scores were replaced, the data was re-analyzed for the school board.
